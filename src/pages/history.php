                <p>Adam's Peak is a 2,243m tall mountain. It is well known for the Sri Pada, 
                    "sacred footprint", a 1.8 m rock formation near the summit, which in Buddhist 
                    tradition is held to be footprint of Buddha. Portuguese Christians believed 
                    St Thomas and the eunuch of Candace, queen of Ethiopia. The footstep is covered 
                    by a handsome roof, and is guarded by the priests of a rich monastery half-way 
                    up the mountain, who maintain a shrine on the summit of the peak.</p>

                <p>The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it 
                    is hard to climb the mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick 
                    mist. A Pali poem "Samantha Kuta Vannama" by a monk named Vedeha in the 13th 
                    century confirms the increasing interest shown by the Sinhala-Buddhists to the 
                    cult of this Footprint. In our recorded history, a good number of ancient kings 
                    have visited the mountain from time to time.</p>

                <p>As indicated by legend, a long time back, Sri Lanka was a radically better place. 
                    Around then, our nation had been tormented by devils, or "Yakshayo", who threatened 
                    and butchered our predecessors for their tomfoolery and cheerfulness. Individuals 
                    didn't aerobics of their homes because of a paranoid fear of being caught by them, 
                    and no little kid could escape from their malicious hooks. Those were dull times…</p>

                <p>Lord Buddha, after seeing this, quickly set out to free our country from this threat 
                    and showed up in Mahiyanganaya to vanquish the Demon. The story goes that lord Buddha 
                    made a whole island called "Giri Divayina" for the evil presences to live in and moved 
                    it far away from Sri Lanka so individuals could live in harmony. It was opportunity as 
                    they had never known…</p>

                <p>A lesson was conveyed by Lord Buddha following this occasion, which happened to the 
                    ears of Lord Saman (or Sumana Saman as he is some of the time known), a divine being 
                    possessing a close by mountain. He was so overwhelmed with feeling and appreciation 
                    that he welcomed Lord Buddha to visit his mountain, and to put Lord Buddha's impression 
                    there for of gift the country. However, this mountain was more modest than Adam's Peak. 
                    Mother earth, after discovering this, had felt that it wasn't ideal for somebody as 
                    radiant and ethical as the Buddha to influence such a modest spot. So as the story proceeds, 
                    she had extended a picture of a dead snake structure Lord Saman's mountain highest point.</p>

                <p>This mountain is referred to the present time as "Kunu diya parvathaya", where "Kunu" or 
                    "Kuna" signifies "body". So, it fundamentally means "Body Rock".</p>

                <p>Taking the picture to be an evil sign, God Saman then, at that point, welcomed lord Buddha 
                    to put his impression on the close by Adam's Peak, which was more noteworthy with respect 
                    to the previous. Thus, the name “Sri Pada” was coined, where it translates to “Sacred Footprint”. 
                    God Saman is currently said to monitor Sri Pada and consequently the expression "Samanala Kanda" 
                    is likewise used to allude to Adam's Peak.</p>

                <p>Concerning how it got the name "Adam's Peak", the Christian and Islamic religions guarantee it to 
                    be where Adam originally set foot on earth subsequent to being projected down from the sky.</p>
