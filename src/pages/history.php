      <h2> Adam's Peak is a <span> 2,243 m </span> tall mountain, </h2>
      <p>It is well known for the Sri Pada, i.e., "sacred footprint", a 1.8 m rock formation near the summit, which in Buddhist tradition is held to be footprint of Buddha. Portuguese Christians believed St Thomas and the eunuch of Candace, queen of Ethiopia. The footstep is covered by a handsome roof, and is guarded by the priests of a rich monastery half-way up the mountain, who maintain a shrine on the summit of the peak.</p> <br><br>
      <p>The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it is hard to climb the mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick mist. A Pali poem "Samantha Kuta Vannama" by a monk named Vedeha in the 13th century confirms the increasing interest shown by the Sinhala-Buddhists to the cult of this Footprint. In our recorded history, a good number of ancient kings have visited the mountain from time to time.</p> <br><br>
      <p>As indicated by legend, a long time back, Sri Lanka was a radically better place. Around then, our nation had been tormented by devils, or "Yakshayo", who threatened and butchered our predecessors for their tomfoolery and cheerfulness. Individuals didn't aerobics of their homes because of a paranoid fear of being caught by them, and no little kid could escape from their malicious hooks. Those were dull times…</p> <br><br>
      <p>Lord Buddha, after seeing this, quickly set out to free our country from this threat and showed up in Mahiyanganaya to vanquish the Demon. The story goes that lord Buddha made a whole island called "Giri Divayina" for the evil presences to live in and moved it far away from Sri Lanka so individuals could live in harmony. It was opportunity as they had never known…</p> <br><br>

      <p>A lesson was conveyed by Lord Buddha following this occasion, which happened to the ears of Lord Saman (or Sumana Saman as he is some of the time known), a divine being possessing a close by mountain. He was so overwhelmed with feeling and appreciation that he welcomed Lord Buddha to visit his mountain, and to put Lord Buddha's impression there for of gift the country. However, this mountain was more modest than Adam's Peak. Mother earth, after discovering this, had felt that it wasn't ideal for somebody as radiant and ethical as the Buddha to influence such a modest spot. So as the story proceeds, she had extended a picture of a dead snake structure Lord Saman's mountain highest point.</p> <br><br>
      <p>This mountain is referred to the present time as "Kunu diya parvathaya", where "Kunu" or "Kuna" signifies "body". So, it fundamentally means "Body Rock".</p> <br><br>
      <p>Taking the picture to be an evil sign, God Saman then, at that point, welcomed lord Buddha to put his impression on the close by Adam's Peak, which was more noteworthy with respect to the previous. Thus, the name “Sri Pada” was coined, where it translates to “Sacred Footprint”. God Saman is currently said to monitor Sri Pada and consequently the expression "Samanala Kanda" is likewise used to allude to Adam's Peak.</p> <br><br>
      <p>Concerning how it got the name "Adam's Peak", the Christian and Islamic religions guarantee it to be where Adam originally set foot on earth subsequent to being projected down from the sky.</p> <br><br>
